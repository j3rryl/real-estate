npx drizzle-kit studio
npx drizzle-kit push -- just push without schema, no need to even migrate


npx drizzle-kit generate generate from schema
npx drizzle-kit migrate push changes to db?
npx drizzle-kit drop
npx drizzle-kit intrspect, generate relations + schema file
generate whenever changes to schema generates another sql file for you! imo


drizzle-kit drop lets you delete previously generated migrations from migrations folder

Please donâ€™t delete any files in migrations folder manually, it might break drizzle-kit
